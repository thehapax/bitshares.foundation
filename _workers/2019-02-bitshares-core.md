Intent
======

* Provide **sustainable protocol development** funding for the BitShares Core Team
* Operate as a multidisciplinary **collaborative team** to benefit the BitShares decentralized autonomous community (DAC) 
* Engage the community, regulators and public as the **authoritative source** for protocol development and information

Background
==========

This budget proposal represents a follow on to the efforts established and executed by the 
[BitShares Core Team in 2018](https://www.bitshares.foundation/workers/2018-03-bitshares-core). It 
seeks to continue funding the development efforts related to the core protocol and expand its scope 
within the DAC to deliver greater outreach throughout 2019. The Core Team is responsible to our DAC 
to transparently deliver a secure protocol, collaborate on research, prioritize innovative features, 
and engage our Community and the public toward increased protocol adoption.

Worker
======

This is a _Budget Worker Proposal_ which funds the following effort areas through calendar year 
2019:

* BitShares Core Development
* Collaboration Tools
* Conference Participation and Community Engagement

This Worker funds a **not to exceed** budget for ideation, collaboration, development and defense of 
the ideas, engagements and implementations required to advance the BitShares Project. Individuals 
supported by funds from the budget occupy a defined set of Core Team Roles at specific rate 
valuations detailed in _Table 2._ below.

BTS are collected into the `"workers.bitshares.foundation"` account which is a multi-sig account
controlled by `"BitShares Blockchain Foundation"` and owned by `"committee-account"` using the
Budget Worker Model [1] which provide:

* Transparent accounting provided by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation [2]
* Invoice review, approval and remittance within 5 business days
* Compensation remitted in a viable SmartCoin (i.e. bitCNY)
* All accumulated and unallocated BTS returned to the Reserve Pool at the conclusion of the Worker

As the team size scales or BTS token valuations fluctuate, subsequent Worker(s) will be offered to 
fully fund the Intent. 

Core Team Scope
===============

The primary focus of the Core Team remains maintenance and development of the 
[core protocol](https://github.com/bitshares.com/bitshares-core) and oversight of the 
[BitShares Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/bitshares.com/bsips) (BSIP) process. The 
Core Team will continue to liaise with the 
[BitShares UI Team](https://github.com/bitshares.com/bitshares-ui), and other community lead efforts 
maintained within the [BitShares Organization](https://github.com/bitshares) on GitHub. The Core Team
continues to guide Community Contributors toward promotion into open Core Team Roles through the 
Community Claims program detailed below. 

Collaboration tools will continue to include software tools and server infrastructure to support 
development and testing efforts. The [bitshares-core](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core) 
GitHub repository remains the primary source for our planning, discussion and deliveries. The Core
Team participates with the UI Team and BitShares Committee to manage access within the 
[BitShares Organization on GitHub](https://github.com/bitshares).

Attendance and speaking engagements at relevant international conferences, hackathons and events
remain an important component of the Core Team's dedication to community outreach. We gather for 
in-person meetings prior to each conference and hold remote planning meetings throughout the year.

Expanded Core Team scope for 2019 will include:

* Participation in one (1) additional international conference
* Multilingual information gathering and dissemination (English and Mandarin)
* Designate the Development Spokesperson(s) for public engagements

BitShares Core Team Members, Roles and Budgeted Effort
======================================================

The Core Team is comprised of an established group of community members who have demonstrated 
their ability to collaborate as a decentralized team, recruit contributions from community members 
and business teams building on the protocol, and advance the pace of innovation throughout 2018. Each
team member is focused on returning more value to the BitShares DAC than is drawn from the reserve 
pool.

This Worker proposes to **budget $26,750 weekly** for funding development efforts of the Core Team 
and Community Claims. Approximately $21,450 are consumed by the established Core Team members, 
leaving $5,300 available for Community Claims or 20% Core Team growth. Demonstrated results of these 
efforts may warrant drafting subsequent Proposals to fund growth beyond this budget. Weekly quality 
effort hours estimations are represented in _Table 1_ below.

BitShares Core Team
===================

The BitShares Core Team is a self-organizing agile-principled team focused on delivering regularly
scheduled releases and ad hoc bug fixes for the BitShares Core software. The actual number of
contributors and roles **may vary** within each development cycle (described below), leading to
variations in weekly compensation per contributor. The Core Team has discretion in allocating 
resources to meet the needs of each development cycle. 

Producing reliable and secure software at scale requires ideation, organization, definition,
prioritization, development, testing and documentation. The ideal team composition includes roles
specializing in each of these functions and capable of contributing to many. The goal of a highly
functioning team is to fully utilize each individual's effort and together maximize their
collective output. 

The Core Team records only "quality effort hours" for the role they are tracking time against. 
Self-reporting is used, tracked within collaboration tools and peer-checked by Team Members to ensure
the effort matches expected quality for the period. 

Development Cycles*
===================
  * Feature Release (non-consensus impacting):
    * Five-week sprints
  * Protocol Upgrade (consensus impacting):
    * Twice annually, with at least 6 months of protocol stability

_*Subject to change upon consensus of Core Team Members_

A typical Feature Release will likely span three weeks from planning thru tested and delivered
software, called a sprint. Many agile principals will be adopted by the Core Team, but do not
expect a strict scrum practice. This is a global team, so a formal daily standup is unlikely. One
should expect asynchronous communication within various collaboration tools keeping the team
informed of progress, plans and problems. The community are our stakeholders; we look to them for
ideas, enhancements and identifying bugs, then organize these into a backlog for future
development. The Coordinator facilitates the prioritization of the backlog items based on feedback
from the stakeholders and the Core Team. The team will keep the stakeholders informed of
development progress throughout the sprint.

At the beginning of a sprint cycle the Core Team meets to review the prioritized backlog and
identify the highest value items that each can contribute to, within the established time block.
Many features have dependencies and cannot be implemented within a single sprint. Therefore, the
team will create tasks, a subset of the feature, that can be delivered on time. A task may be
researching and defining requirements to be implemented later. A task may be writing a test case,
or perhaps implementing only a subset of a given requirement, or even documenting how existing code
functions. The team will maintain a sprint backlog comprised of the tasks selected from the project 
backlog. Completing each of these tasks results in incremental value added to the project. Testing 
is performed throughout the sprint to ensure functioning code from each increment. 

As the sprint nears completion, the Core Team will begin release planning. They will select which
tested increments are ready to be included in a release candidate. This will be deployed to a
staging network for final validation. A release will be tagged within the bitshares-core GitHub
repo along with release notes. The team also produce stakeholder documentation detailing resource
allocations and budget consumption.

The final steps of the sprint include a retrospective look at how the team performed. Here we
reflect on our original estimates, the delivered increments and what contributed to our successes
and shortcomings. We will use insights gained from the retrospective to improve in the next sprint.
The following day we immediately begin our next sprint cycle.

Community Claims 
================

The BitShares Core Team maintain a prioritized 
[Project Backlog](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/projects/6:) of ideas, enhancements, 
bugs and BSIPs which they select from for their development sprint. The community is encouraged to 
comment on the items to aid in refining requirements and guide prioritization. Effort estimates are 
first assigned to the highest value backlog items. Unassigned **and estimated** project backlog items
are available for ad hoc _bounty_ development. Claiming and successfully completing backlog items is 
a primary consideration for an invitation to join the Core Team on a future sprint.

The Core Team encourages ad hoc code contributions of estimated project backlog items from any
community member and will compensate successfully merged code based on estimates approved by Core
Developers. The Coordinator will facilitate onboarding new community contributors to _claim_ a 
backlog item and implement a solution that fits within architecture design defined by the Core Team. 
Care must be taken to ensure effort is not duplicated and can easily be merged within a future 
sprint. Claimed items that become a dependency of a sprint may be recalled by the Core Team to
facilitate feature delivery. Compensation for a partially completed increment will be evaluated by 
the Q/A Lead and Coordinator.

Funding for Community Claims comes from unallocated budget within the _Core Team Effort Budget_ 
resulting from open Roles on the Core Team as detailed in _Table 1_. 

BitShares Core Team Framework:
==============================
Accountability
* Maintain timely collaborative communications with each BitShares Core Team Member
* Maintain effort estimates as development progresses and alert team members of changes promptly
* Acceptable quality effort is subject to the approval of the Core Team, Escrow Agent and ultimately
the BTS Token Holders

Transparency
* Maintain working increments within Community facing collaboration tools
* Maintain timely updates of effort estimations within relevant Issues
* Track quality effort hours within appropriate collaboration tools

Delivery
* Deliver the highest value work first
* Favor release schedule over feature completeness (see Development Cycles)

BitShares Core Team Member 'Contract Work' Guidance:
====================================================

Autonomous Community (BitShares DAC) controls the funds collected by this Budget Worker and are 
issued as compensation to individuals performing agreed work as described elsewhere in this document.
Effort contributed by individuals is considered by personal commitment as no formal employment
contract is intended or able to be formed between BitShares DAC and the individual worker. Neither 
the BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF) nor the BitShares Committee or any individual serving those
entities are to be considered employers of any agreed contribution. No BitShares Core Team Member or 
Role is considered the manager or the employer of any individual person. Any compensation received 
from the BitShares DAC might be considered earned income for individual persons involved in their 
individual situation and may be subject to tax reporting by the recipient. Neither BitShares DAC, nor
the BitShares Blockchain Foundation, nor BitShares Committee, nor the Coordinator, or any Core Team
Member will neither carry responsibility, nor command, nor issue, nor prepare any document, including
tax documents, to any entity or natural person. All effort performed is a contribution to the 
BitShares DAC adhering to its MIT license.

Each Core Team Member is encouraged to contribute in a responsible way with respect to a work/life 
balance and legal employee engagements he or she might have entered into, or enter, with an employer.

Development Initiatives
=======================

The Team has identified in _Chart 1_ a set of Initiatives to research, define and develop as part of 
their 2019 Roadmap. 

**Caveat**: The Core Team cannot commit to deliver fully implemented solutions for all identified
Initiatives. The intent here is to provide guidance at the outset, realizing the Core Team
continuously evaluates and prioritizes new development tasks ongoing.

* Hardware Wallet Integrations
* Inter-blockchain Communication
  * Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC)
  * Atomic Cross Chain Swaps (ACCS)
  * Interledger Protocol (ILP)
    * Check Sequence Verify (CSV)
    * Check Lock Time Verify (CLTV)
  * Trustless Gateway
* Privacy Protections
  * Confidential Assets / Transactions
  * Bullet Proofs
* Market Mechanics
  * Global Settlement Mechanics
  * Dynamic Market Fees
  * P2P Lending
  * Maker/Taker Model
* Consensus & witness_node Enhancements
  * Security and Performance Improvements

Worker Budget
=============

The budget items listed in the tables below represent an **upper bound** on expenditures. All funds
collected and unused at the conclusion of this Worker Proposal will be returned to the Reserve
Pool [5-6].

**Table 8. Core Team Budget**

Duration and Pay
================

**Duration:**
This proposal will last for 47 weeks, starting from 4th February 2019, ending on 29th December 2019.

**Transparent Accounting:**
* Invoices from Core Team Members will be submitted to the Coordinator by Monday 12:00 UTC for work
performed thru Sunday 23:59 UTC of the previous period
* Coordinator will review and approve submitted time sheets, then forward invoices to BitShares
Blockchain Foundation for release of funds from escrow to contributor's account
* Coordinator will review and approve vendor invoices, then forward to BitShares Blockchain
Foundation for direct payment to vendor

**Devaluation Multiplier:**
This Worker introduces a _devaluation multiplier_ to mitigate the impacts of a depreciating BTS token 
during the active period. We propose to protect against prolonged BTS devaluation of approximately 
one-third (-33%) by using a 1.50 _devaluation multiplier_. Initially, BTS will be accumulated at rate
150% of the required daily budget. The BBF will use the accumulated BTS to purchase bitCNY from the 
market, up to the _Core Team Budget_ detailed above in _Table 8_. 

**Calculations (as of 27 JAN 2019):**
* 6.75 = USD/CNY foreign exchange rate
* 3.93824 = bitCNY/BTS price feed 
* 1.50 = Devaluation multiplier to mitigate market fluctuations
* **168,032 BTS/day** ≈ $4,214 USD/day * 6.75 USD/CNY * 3.93824 bitCNY/BTS * 1.50 devaluation multiplier 

**Payments:**
All payments are converted from USD and remitted in bitCNY with method developed by the BitShares 
Blockchain Foundation [1].
