Intent
======

* Establish a **budget** to sustain the development efforts of the BitShares Core Team
* Define a **framework** for the Core Team to collaborate within
* Provide transparent **delivery** of BitShares development efforts to the community

Background
==========

BitShares Core software is currently maintained by individuals either volunteering their time or
receiving funding through distinct short-term worker proposals. The BitShares community has
recognized the need for organized development efforts to increase the utility of our platform.
There is a large backlog of ideas and requirements lacking prioritization, including feature
enhancements, bug fixes, and BSIPs. Therefore, proposed is the establishment of a long-term,
professional, global team dedicated to cohesive and comprehensive development efforts delivered
transparently.

Worker
======

This is a Budget Worker Proposal which provides **partial** funding through calendar year 2018 for:
* BitShares Core Team Roles
* Collaboration Tools
* Development Initiatives

This Worker funds an _initial_ Core Team at **reduced hours** to mitigate draw on the reserve pool
and support **bootstrapping** efforts. Subsequent Worker(s) will be offered to fund the team as it
scales up. This Worker intends to work in concert with the existing development resources including
Abit, Alfredo Garcia, and the UI Team, led by Bill Butler. 

BTS are collected into the `workers.bitshares.foundation` account which is a multi-sig account
controlled by BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF) and owned by `committee-account` using the
Budget Worker Model [5]:

* Transparent accounting provided by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation [6]
* Submitted invoices reviewed, approved and remitted within 5 business days
* Compensation paid in bitUSD (according to the rules set forth in [5])
* All unused accumulated BTS returned to the Reserve Pool at the conclusion of the Worker [5]

_Initial_ BitShares Core Team
=============================

The initial Core Team is comprised of community members who have demonstrated their ability to work
with Graphene-based code, contribute to this community with thoughtful leadership and share a
dedication to the BitShares ethos. Initially, the team is a skeleton, with many contributing to
multiple roles and at reduced weekly hours as represented in _Table 1_ Each team member is focused
on returning more value to the BitShares platform than is drawn from the reserve pool.

The initial team is estimating 54 hours of weekly effort. This Worker proposes to **budget $15,000**
for a team delivering approximately 100 hours weekly to support conservative growth. Demonstrated
results will warrant subsequent Worker(s) to budget for additional team members and weekly hours.

**Table 1. Initial BitShares Core Team**

_^Abit and Alfredo intend to complete their existing Workers. Their contributions as part of the Core Team will initially be at the reduced hours above, then expected to increase similar to their existing Worker.

^^Additional hours for all roles remain available at this time. Please contact fox@bitshares.boston for additional information._

BitShares Core Team
===================

The BitShares Core Team is a self-organizing agile-principled team focused on delivering regularly
scheduled releases and ad hoc bug fixes for the BitShares Core software. The actual number of
contributors and roles **may vary** within each development cycle (described below), leading to
variations in weekly compensation per contributor. The team has discretion in allocating resources
to meet the needs of each development cycle. 

Producing reliable and secure software at scale requires ideation, organization, definition,
prioritization, development, testing and documentation. The ideal team composition includes roles
specializing in each of these functions and capable of contributing to many. The goal of a highly
functioning team is to fully utilize each individual's effort and together maximize their
collective output. 

Development Cycles^
===================

* Feature Release (non-hard fork):
  * Three-week sprints
* Core Release (Hard Fork):
  * Twice annually: first Thursday of June & December

_^Subject to change upon consensus of Core Team Members_

A typical Feature Release will likely span three weeks from planning thru tested and delivered
software, called a sprint. Many agile principals will be adopted by the Core Team, but do not
expect a strict scrum practice. This is a global team, so a formal daily standup is unlikely. One
should expect asynchronous communication within various collaboration tools keeping the team
informed of progress, plans and problems. The community are our stakeholders; we look to them for
ideas, enhancements and identifying bugs, then organize these into a backlog for future
development. The Coordinator facilitates the prioritization of the backlog items based on feedback
from the stakeholders and the Core Team. The team will keep the stakeholders informed of
development progress throughout the sprint.

At the beginning of a sprint cycle the Core Team meets to review the prioritized backlog and
identify the highest value items that each can contribute to, within the established time block.
Many features have dependencies and cannot be implemented within a single sprint. Therefore, the
team will create tasks, a subset of the feature, that can be delivered on time. A task may be
researching and defining requirements to be implemented later. A task may be writing a test case,
or perhaps implementing only a subset of a given requirement, or even documenting how existing code
functions. The team will maintain a sprint backlog comprised of the tasks selected from the project 
backlog. Completing each of these tasks results in incremental value added to the project. Testing 
is performed throughout the sprint to ensure functioning code from each increment. 

As the sprint nears completion, the Core Team will begin release planning. They will select which
tested increments are ready to be included in a release candidate. This will be deployed to a
staging network for final validation. A release will be tagged within the bitshares-core GitHub
repo along with release notes. The team also produce stakeholder documentation detailing resource
allocations and budget consumption.

The final steps of the sprint include a retrospective look at how the team performed. Here we
reflect on our original estimates, the delivered increments and what contributed to our successes
and shortcomings. We will use insights gained from the retrospective to improve in the next sprint.
The following day we immediately begin our next sprint cycle.

Bounty Process (Implicit Budget)
================================

The BitShares Core Team maintain a prioritized project backlog of ideas, enhancements, bugs and
BSIPs which they select from for their development sprint. The community is encouraged to comment
on the items to aid in refining requirements and guide prioritization. Effort estimates are first
assigned to the highest value backlog items. Unassigned **and estimated** project backlog items are
available for ad hoc _bounty_ development. Successfully completing ad hoc bounty items is a primary
consideration for an invitation to join the Core Team on a future sprint.

The Core Team encourages ad hoc code contributions of estimated project backlog items from
community members and will compensate successfully merged code based on those estimates. The
Coordinator will facilitate onboarding new community contributors to _claim_ a backlog item and
implement a solution that fits within the broader architecture design defined by the Lead
Developer. Care must be taken to ensure effort is not duplicated and can easily be merged within a
future sprint. Claimed items that become a dependency of a sprint may be recalled by the Core Team
to facilitate feature delivery. Compensation for a partially completed increment will be evaluated
by the Lead Developer.

Compensation for a successfully merged _bounty_ item is drawn from the excess _implicit_ budget
capacity within _Table 1_ when any Core Team Role is not fully allocated. The specifics for the
bounty process is still being revised (note: it is largely based on the process in use by the UI
Team).

BitShares Core Team Framework:
==============================
Accountability
* Maintain timely collaborative communications with each BitShares Core Team Member
* Participate in at least two of three weekly Collaboration Sessions (see Coordinator description)
* Target a majority of your weekly hours between Tuesday - Thursday
  * Facilitates ad hoc collaboration
  * Facilitates healthy work/life balance

Transparency
* Maintain working increments within Community facing collaboration tools
* Maintain timely updates within Community facing collaboration tools of work in progress and development priorities

Delivery
* Deliver the highest value work first
* Favor release schedule over feature completeness (see Development Cycles)

BitShares Core Team Member 'Contract Work' Guidance:
====================================================

This section is to be considered guidance, not a legal statement. The BitShares
Decentralized Autonomous Community (BitShares DAC) controls the funds collected
by this Budget Worker and are issued as compensation to individuals performing
agreed work as described elsewhere in this document. Effort contributed by
individuals is considered by personal commitment as no formal employment
contract is intended or able to be formed between BitShares DAC and the
individual worker. Neither the BitShares Blockchain Foundation (BBF) nor the
BitShares Committee or any individual serving those entities are to be
considered employers of any agreed contribution. No BitShares Core Team Member
or Role is considered the manager or the employer of any individual person. Any
compensation received from the BitShares DAC might be considered earned income
for individual persons involved in their individual situation and may be
subject to tax reporting by the recipient. Neither BitShares DAC, nor the
BitShares Blockchain Foundation, nor BitShares Committee, nor the Coordinator,
or any Core Team Member will neither carry responsibility, nor command, nor
issue, nor prepare any document, including tax documents, to any entity or
natural person. All effort performed is a contribution to the BitShares DAC
adhering to its MIT license.

Each Core Team Member is encouraged to contribute in a responsible way with
respect to a work/life balance and legal employee engagements he or she might
have entered into, or enter, with an employer.

Duration and Pay
================

This proposal will last for approximately 42 weeks, starting from 15th March 2018.

Payments:
* Invoices from Core Team Members will be submitted to the Coordinator by Monday 12:00 UTC for work performed thru Sunday 23:59 UTC of the previous period
* Coordinator will review and approve submitted time sheets, then forward an invoice to BitShares Blockchain Foundation for release of funds (bitUSD) from escrow to `"bitsharesdev"` account for remittance to contributors

Calculation:
* 4.4934 BTS/bitUSD = Settlement price of bitUSD at the moment of writing (2018-03-01)
* 2.5 = Collateral multiplier to cover market fluctuations and borrow with 2.5x collateral, as needed
* $2,421 USD/day * 4.4934 BTS/USD * 2.5 collateral multiplier ≈ 27,196 BTS/day

USD payment will be in bitUSD with method developed by the BitShares Blockchain Foundation [5].
